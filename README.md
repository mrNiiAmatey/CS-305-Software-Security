# CS-305-Software-Security
Artemis Financial is a forward-thinking consulting firm specializing in crafting personalized financial plans that address a wide range of client needs. Our comprehensive financial solutions include strategies for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. With an unwavering commitment to excellence and innovation, Artemis Financial continuously modernizes its operational procedures by incorporating the most up-to-date and efficient software security measures available. Our public web interface is a crucial component of our service delivery, and ensuring its security is paramount to protecting our client’s sensitive data and maintaining their trust.

A key initiative in our ongoing security enhancement efforts is the integration of a file verification step into our web application. This new feature is designed to certify secure communications, ensuring that every file transmitted through our platform is authenticated and free from tampering. By verifying files before they are processed, we are reducing the risk of malicious code or data breaches, thereby bolstering our overall security posture.

As part of this initiative, I undertook the task of refactoring the existing code base of our software application. The goal was to align our systems with the latest security protocols and best practices. Refactoring the code not only helped mitigate known vulnerabilities but also laid the foundation for a more robust and maintainable system. Secure coding is essential in today’s digital landscape—not only does it preserve user trust and protect our brand integrity, but it also ensures regulatory compliance and helps avoid potential legal issues. These factors are critical to the overall well-being and reputation of Artemis Financial.

One of the most challenging aspects of the vulnerability assessment process was identifying and filtering out false positives generated by our dependency-check tools. During the assessment, the OWASP Dependency-Check Maven tool flagged several potential issues. However, many of these alerts turned out to be false positives. By carefully reviewing the output and consulting community resources, including detailed responses on Stack Overflow, I was able to distinguish genuine vulnerabilities from benign warnings. This meticulous approach ensured that our mitigation efforts were focused only on real risks.

To enhance our security further, I increased the layers of protection by incorporating advanced algorithms and several security frameworks into the system. These measures add multiple levels of defense against potential threats and ensure that our application remains resilient against evolving security challenges. Following the refactoring process, I conducted another round of vulnerability assessments using the OWASP Dependency-Check Maven tool. This final check confirmed that no new vulnerabilities had been inadvertently introduced during the refactoring process.

In addition, I utilized the Java Keytool to create a self-signed certificate, which plays a critical role in encrypting communications and verifying identities. The implementation of the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function further ensures data integrity by making it nearly impossible for unauthorized parties to alter transmitted data without detection. Looking ahead, I plan to continue leveraging the OWASP Dependency-Check Maven tool for regular vulnerability assessments and to refine our mitigation strategies as new challenges emerge. This proactive approach to software security is essential in maintaining our clients’ trust and safeguarding the integrity of Artemis Financial’s digital infrastructure.

This comprehensive refactoring and enhancement project not only secures our current operations but also provides a strong foundation for future technological advancements and security innovations at Artemis Financial.
