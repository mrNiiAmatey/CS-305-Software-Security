# CS-305-Software-Security
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that cultivates personalized financial plans for its customers for instance, the financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. One of Artemis Financial’s objectives is to modernize its procedures and use the most up-to-date and efficient software security. Artemis Financial has a public web interface. Unambiguously, Artemis Financial aims to add a file verification step to its web application to certify secure communications. 
Refactoring the code base of Artemis Financial’s software application to meet the latest software security was part of what I did to mitigate the company's security vulnerabilities. It is important to code securely to maintain user trust and brand integrity and ensure compliance to avoid legal issues. These same factors add to a company’s overall well-being. The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was to figure out what the false positives were after running a Dependency-check and reading a few answers on Stack Overflow helped.
I increased layers of security by using an Algorithm and several frameworks. In the future,  I would like to use the OWASP Dependency-Check Maven again to assess vulnerabilities and elect which mitigation techniques to utilize. After refactoring the code, I used OWASP Dependency-Check Maven check to see whether I initiated new vulnerabilities. 
I found using the Java Keytool to create a self-signed certificate useful as well as using the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function.
